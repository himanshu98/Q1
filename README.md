# Q1
solution of Q1 of backend assignment


1. You are given an integer ​ N ​ denoting an ​ NxN​ matrix. Initially,
each cell of the matrix is empty. You are given ​ K ​ tasks. In each
task, you are given a cell ​ (i,j)​ where the cell ​ (i,j)​ represents the ​ i
row and ​ j ​ column of the given matrix.You have to perform each
task sequentially in the given order. Each task is described in a
cell ​ (i,j)​ . For each task, you have to place ​ X ​ in each cell of row
and each cell column . After you complete each task, you are
required to print the number of empty cells in the matrix.
Input format:
1. The first line contains two space-separated integers N and
K​ where ​ N ​ is the number of rows and columns in the given
matrix and ​ K ​ is the number of tasks respectively.
2. Next ​ K ​ lines contain two space-separated integers.
Output format:
Print ​ K ​ space-separated integers denoting the number of
empty cells in the matrix.
